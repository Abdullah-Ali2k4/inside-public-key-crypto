# inside-public-key-crypto
This repository explains the mathematical foundations of public-key cryptography, especially RSA. It breaks down the role of prime numbers (p, q), modulus n, Euler’s totient ϕ(n), public exponent e, and private key d. It also explores how these principles power real-world systems like SSH for secure remote access.
